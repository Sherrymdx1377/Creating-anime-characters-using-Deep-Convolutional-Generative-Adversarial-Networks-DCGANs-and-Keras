# Creating-anime-characters-using-Deep-Convolutional-Generative-Adversarial-Networks-DCGANs-and-Keras

# Project Overview

This project focuses on utilizing Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) implemented with Keras to generate unique anime characters. The goal is to automate the creation of diverse and visually appealing characters for a video game, catering to the ever-growing player base.

# Setup

For this project, the following libraries are used:

- pandas for managing the data.
- numpy for mathematical operations.
- sklearn for machine learning and machine-learning-pipeline related functions.
- seaborn for visualizing the data.
- matplotlib for additional plotting tools.
- keras for loading datasets.
- tensorflow for machine learning and neural network related functions.

# How to Use

- Install the required libraries by following the instructions in Installing Required Libraries.
- Import the necessary libraries as outlined in Importing Required Libraries.
- Define any helper functions needed for the project using Defining Helper Functions.
- Proceed with the project sections, starting with Basic: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
